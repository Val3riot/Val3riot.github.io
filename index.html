                I am a 21 years old and  started the first years of computer science students. After I gave up engineering  started this path and this is a proof of my knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a good programming knowledge, but this is the first time that i study c language and more.
            </p>
            <p>Besides a programming course, started a physic, logic and linear algebra classes that are very important for this university course.</p>
            <p>
                In the next reports report my progress only in the programming classes and in other research that excites me. Basically, this is a pretense for learning English language and improve my web knowledge(a field that hate).
