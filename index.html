                I am a 21 years old and i started the first years of computer science students. After I gave up engineering i started this path and this is a proof of my knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a good programming knowledge but this is the first time that i study c language and more.
            </p>
            <p>Besides a programming course, i started a physic, logic and linear algebra classes that are most important for this univerity course.</p>
            <p>
                In the nexr reports i report my progress only in the programming classes and in other research that exites me. Basically this is pretense for learning english languange and improve my web knowledge(a field that i hate).
